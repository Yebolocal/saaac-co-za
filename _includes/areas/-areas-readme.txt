The site areas are the site areas built into Yebojek, jsut add the code you want in the site area into the file for that site area. Perhaps you would like to place a widget holder in a site area or just a widget or maybe a background image.

Some of the areas are for a spesific purpose and should not contain widgets or widget holders, they can include background image. These areas are :
- the nav area = is for the navigation bar
- content area = is for the main content of the page, with or without a sidebar, if there is a sidebar in a layout then you need to specify which sidebar file to use.
- footer = is for the site footer, usally all that is here is the copyright info and that kind of stuff.
