The site areas are the site areas built into Yebojek, just add the code you want in the site area into the file for that site area. Perhaps you would like to place a row of widgets in a site area or just a widget or maybe a background image.

Some of the areas are for a spesific purpose, they can include background image. These areas are :
- the nav area = is for the navigation bar
- content area = is for the main content of the page
- footer = is for the site footer, usally all that is here is the copyright info and that kind of stuff.
