The user create a layout by filling in this text in the layout file
--------------------------

topbar: includes/areas/topbars/topbar.html
topbanner: includes/areas/topbanner/topbanner.html
navtop: includes/areas/navtops/navtop.html
nav: includes/areas/navs/nav.html
navbottom: includes/areas/navbottom/navbottom.html
content: includes/areas/content/content-sidebar-none.html
extra1: includes/areas/extras/extra1.html
extra2: includes/areas/extras/extra2.html
footer: includes/areas/footers/footer.html

The user places there code in the corresponding file in the areas folder
--------------------------

/areas/topbars/topbar.html
/areas/topbanner/topbanner.html
/areas/navtops/navtop.html
/areas/navs/nav.html
/areas/navbottom/navbottom.html
/areas/content/content-sidebar-none.html
/areas/extras/extra1.html
/areas/extras/extra2.html
/areas/footers/footer.html

The user can use blocks and widgets to grouop code together
--------------------------
Instead of placing the code in the area file they can just refer to a block in the area file and have the code in the block file.

The reason for this might be becuase 

Blocks can contain widgets

This is how to make a widget holder with for example 3 widgets next to one another - This widget holder can then be placed in one of the site areas
