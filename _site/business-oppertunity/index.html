<p>Interested in becoming your own boss but with the support you need?</p>

<p>We are looking for qualified professionals interested in starting their own business.</p>

<p>I know many of us have researched different options in opening a business but there is always something in the way to actually achieving this goal, whether it be money or anything else. I even went as far to research educational franchises but was shocked to see that the cheapest was around R1m. I didn’t have that amount of money, so my dream ended.</p>

<p>I worked for a company for many years only to be retrenched. You can just imagine what thoughts pass through your head. What am I going to do? How am I going to survive? I have two young girls who need to be educated!</p>

<p>By chance I spoke to someone who was willing to listen. They did not only listen but reacted. After sleepless nights and high levels of stress I am now able to face tomorrow.</p>

<p>I am so proud to say that I am now part of SA Academy. I with the rest of the crew plan to develop this business of mine to one that will not only be beneficial to me as a young entrepreneur, but to the people whom I intend to serve.</p>

<p>Where can you find an accredited institution that is willing to assist without bankrupting you first? If you are feeling what I have been through, pop me an email at adele@saaac.co.za</p>

<p>Maybe I can share my experience with you and you could also become a proud member of our new brand and one of the crew.</p>

<p>If you can answer these questions positively you may be at the right place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I passionate about education?</li>
<li>Am I a hard worker?</li>
<li>Am I a people’s person?</li>
<li>Am I a team player?</li>
<li>Do I lead by example?</li>
<li>Am I honest and reliable?</li>
<li>Am I ready for the long haul?</li>
<li>Do I want to grow with a company who is committed to succeed?</li>
<li>Am I an educator at heart?</li>
<li>Am I ready to commit?</li>
</ul>


<p>If you can answer yes to all above, feel free to contact me and I will explain to you just how easy it is to become part of SA Academy of Applied Competence?</p>

<p>There are different areas available, so contact me to find out if your region is still available.</p>
