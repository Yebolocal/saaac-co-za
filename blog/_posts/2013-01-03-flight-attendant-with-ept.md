To operate as a cabin crew member on a South African registered aircraft you are required to be in possession of a cabin crew member’s license which is issued by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA). Our cabin crew member licensing course covers all the training modules required by the SACAA for the licensing of crew. Our training exceeds regulatory requirements as we have a fully operable aircraft on our premises at Denel which allows learning to take place in a lifelike environment and our aircraft visits are more frequent than the legislation requires.
All our regulatory training modules are more restrictive than is required by the SACAA:
Theoretical and Practical modules relating to the licensing of cabin crew members:

- Theoretical Safety and Security policies and procedures inclusive of Air Law
- Practical Emergency Procedures inclusive of use of Emergency and survival equipment, Ditching and Survival Training, Live Fire Fighting, Evacuation from an aircraft
- Practical and Theoretical Aircraft Type Training
- Carriage of Dangerous Goods by air
- Crew Resource Management
- Aviation Medicine

Course Entry Requirements:
 
- A Class 2 medical certificate – This is required when you apply for a cabin crew member’s license with the SACAA. This certificate is required prior to commencement of training.
- Minimum of 18 years of age (at the time of writing the SACAA examination)
- Proficient in the English language
 
Course Cost includes:
 
- All required training material and stationery
- Hannon Grooming Kit
