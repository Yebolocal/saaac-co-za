Interested in becoming your own boss but with the support you need?

We are looking for qualified professionals interested in starting their own business.

I know many of us have researched different options in opening a business but there is always something in the way to actually achieving this goal, whether it be money or anything else. I even went as far to research educational franchises but was shocked to see that the cheapest was around R1m. I didn’t have that amount of money, so my dream ended.

I worked for a company for many years only to be retrenched. You can just imagine what thoughts pass through your head. What am I going to do? How am I going to survive? I have two young girls who need to be educated!

By chance I spoke to someone who was willing to listen. They did not only listen but reacted. After sleepless nights and high levels of stress I am now able to face tomorrow.

I am so proud to say that I am now part of SA Academy. I with the rest of the crew plan to develop this business of mine to one that will not only be beneficial to me as a young entrepreneur, but to the people whom I intend to serve.

Where can you find an accredited institution that is willing to assist without bankrupting you first? If you are feeling what I have been through, pop me an email at adele@saaac.co.za

Maybe I can share my experience with you and you could also become a proud member of our new brand and one of the crew.

If you can answer these questions positively you may be at the right place:

* Am I passionate about education?
* Am I a hard worker?
* Am I a people’s person?
* Am I a team player?
* Do I lead by example?
* Am I honest and reliable?
* Am I ready for the long haul?
* Do I want to grow with a company who is committed to succeed?
* Am I an educator at heart?
* Am I ready to commit?

If you can answer yes to all above, feel free to contact me and I will explain to you just how easy it is to become part of SA Academy of Applied Competence?

There are different areas available, so contact me to find out if your region is still available.
