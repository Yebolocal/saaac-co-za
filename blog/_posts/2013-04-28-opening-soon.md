Dear Learners

Welcome to the SA Academy of Applied Competence. We are proud to announce our new College which opens in Queenstown on 2 May 2013. The Executive Team is of the opinion that an affordable, yet high quality learning academy was something that the Eastern Cape needed.

Adele Richardson, one of the Directors will be 'the go to' person, if you require any information. You can contact her or any of her highly qualified staff if you need any further information.

We look forward to welcoming each of you into the Academy and our opening specials are something that cannot be missed.

Please tell your friends and family about our venture and we look forward to a long and successful relationship.

Yours sincerely

Chief Executive Officer
